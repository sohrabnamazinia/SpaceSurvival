# Space Survival
I created Planet Survival by Unity as a new Idea based on the mixture of two classic games "subway surfers" and "Food drop" <br />
This game is related to milions of year in the future, and the planets are all exploiding and crashing. You have to run away by your circle huge spacecraft. <br />
You shouldn't touch non-earth planets. If so, you will lose some part of your health, and when you lose all of it, the game is over.
You can also gain score by touching earth-like planets. <br />
Be careful about on of the planets that has a shape like earth, but it is a bit different. <br />
Here is the list of important features of the game:

- [x] Use Scriptable objects 
- [x] Use Prefabs
- [x] Change size of planets at runtime 
- [x] Change mass of planets based on size at runtime
- [x] Reduce Health as a function of crashed planet size 
- [x] different planet shapes
- [x] Update score based on crashed earths
- [x] Making the game tricky by a similarity between an earth and a planet
- [x] Finish game if Health is 0
- [x] Change Health color based on its amount
- [x] Use Inheritence
- [x] Add Windows build
